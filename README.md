# Overview

As a software engineer seeking to enhance my proficiency in TypeScript, I developed a simple to-do list application. This project served as a practical exercise to solidify my understanding of TypeScript language features, including classes, interfaces, and modules. The primary goal was to create a functional and well-structured application that demonstrates best practices in TypeScript development.

The software allows users to manage a to-do list by adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed. This project aimed to showcase my ability to design and implement a TypeScript application, focusing on clean code, modularity, and effective use of TypeScript features.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
